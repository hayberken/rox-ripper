Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extract the tgz file and run the application.  Select the Preferences button and configure
things for your system.  It is best if you are familiar with making cdda2wav and lame
work from the command line.

The LUN value in Options|Ripper is the device that is actually used by cdda2wav for ripping.
If you have an IDE/ATAPI cdrom drive you may need to use the 'ATAPI:' prefix.  Otherwise
(e.g. you are using scsi or ide-scsi) just the normal lun specification should work.

Some options necessary to make cdda2wav and lame work with Ripper are hardcoded into the
application.  Others may be added by the user.  See the cdda2wav and lame man pages.

The refresh button will re-query the cddb server and reload the cd information.  Currently,
if there are multiple returns from cddb one is chosen at random, so repeated clicking of
the refresh button is the only way to see the others (this will change).

Clicking the rip & encode button starts ripping and encoding as parallel threads.  The
progress of each song is shown.  Ripping will almost always finish long before Encoding.
Therefore you may eject the CD (there is an auto setting for this) and load another CD
while the previous one is still encoding.  However the new CD will not be read until the
encoding is done.

Double clicking on each song will let you edit the track name.  The track name is used
in the mp3 id tag literally, but the mp3 filename has certain characters replaced
automatically.  (there may later be an option to edit this replacement list.  there may
also later be an option to allow things like Year, Genre, Artist, etc. to be edited
per song this way.)

Clicking the Stop button aborts both ripping and encoding and displays 'error' in the
status area.

Each wav file is deleted after encoding, whether successful or not.
