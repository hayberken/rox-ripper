Rippers
~~~~~~~
Commands and parameters for supported ripper commands.

cdda2wav:
	cdda2wav -g -x -H -D/dev/cdrom -A/dev/cdrom -t $T "$F"

	This is the fastest ripper on my system.  However it takes over the CPU
	so much that I always run it with 'nice'.

cdparanoia:
	cdparanoia -e $T "$F"

	The -e parameter is required to get progress reporting from cdparanoia
	as this generates a lot of extra output, performance is a bit lower.


Encoders 
~~~~~~~~
These examples also add tags to the file.  You could remove these parameters
if you use a separate tagging application.

lame:
	lame --ta "$A" --tt "$S" --tl "$L" --tg "$G" --tn $T --ty $Y "$F.wav" "$F.mp3"

oggenc:
	oggenc -a "$A" -t "$S" -l "$L" -G "$G" -N $T -d $Y "$F.wav" -o "$F.oga"

	Note: Recent mime-type database lists *.ogg as Video.  Set to *.oga for Audio.
